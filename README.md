# Extend VBA notifications with Notify.ahk  
   
**Allows picking and formatting header, body, bg, sound, icon, position, adding hyperlinks**

- atm the Automator's version.  
- will work on XMCQCX's version next

**and callback vba macros by clicking on the notification**

---

_known issues_ 
 
- can't have multiple notifications  
- can't pass arguments (shouldn't be necessary though)  
- Links replace the BDBody instead of placing links beneath it
- can't have Links and Callback simultaneously
